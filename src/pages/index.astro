      He came to the sound of angels singing and then spent the next thirty
      years learning carpentry. Even during his public ministry, he spent most
      of his time going at a slow pace in a small place. This is unstrategic not
      because there was no plan, but because the plan doesn’t make sense! Yet
      the madness of this plan is exactly how God chose to display the
      upside-down nature of his Kingdom. Jesus won by dying. Jesus chose two
      women to witness the resurrection. Jesus built his church on the preaching
      of one of his betrayers. <a href='#imaginary'

      <p>
        Yet we believe rural ministry presents a unique opportunity to display
        the very upside-down gospel we proclaim. Going at a slow pace in a small
        place as we win by dying embodies the gospel logic of John 12:24. The
        slowness and smallness of this kind of ministry requires a certain kind
        of <strong>gospel imaginary</strong> from those who pastor here. It’s the
        kind of imaginary Wendell Berry calls for in his poem <em
          >Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front:</em
        >

        So, friends, every day do something
        that won’t compute....
        Invest in the millennium. Plant sequoias.
        Say that your main crop is the
        forest that you did not plant, that you will not live to harvest.</pre>
      <p>
        We’ve caught this madness. And out of this gospel madness flows <a
